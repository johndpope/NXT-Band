NXT Band
--------

NXT Band allows OS X users to record and play back NXT melody files (RMD). NXT Band's on-screen piano keyboard lets users quickly pluck out tunes and save them in the RMD file format. MIDI keyboards can also be used as input sources, and notes can even be drawn by hand in the familiar piano roll view.
